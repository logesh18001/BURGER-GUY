        <p>Vegetarian versions aside, the most important element of any burger is the meat. A high-quality butcher shop
            burger blend (typically a mix of brisket, chuck, and ribeye) with a lean to fat ratio of 80/20 delivers the
            ideal balance of meaty flavor and juiciness. “Always use fresh ground beef,” says George Motz, burger
            historian, and chef/owner of Hamburger America in NYC. Freshly ground meat — ideally ground the same day
            you’ll cook it — has a loose texture that, when shaped into patties using a gentle hand, will result in
            supple, melt-in-your-mouth burgers. Purchasing beef that has been pressed into a tube or mashed into a mound
            is a sure way to end up with tough patties.but we found a cast iron griddle or skillet, which provides the
            surface area to encourage caramelization while also trapping the drippings and preventing flare-ups, yielded
            better-tasting burgers. (Pro tip: The pool of residual drippings on the griddle are liquid gold, superb for
            toasting buns or sautéing vegetables). </p>
